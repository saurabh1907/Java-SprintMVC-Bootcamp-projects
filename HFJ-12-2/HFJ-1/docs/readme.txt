(
	Ref: Head First JAVAScript
	Chapter#1	The interactive web
) 

Notes:
--------

JAVAScript is a scripting language. It will be executed on the client (the web browser).

Typically, any Web page consists of HTML, CSS and JAVAScript.
	HTML is used to provide structure of document.
	CSS is used to provide style to the document.
	JAVAAScript is used to add interactivity to the document.

All modern day web browser has JAVAScript interpreter to execute the client side script.

The script will be executed when user asks the page to perform some task.
 
Generally, it'll be executed against event like page loading,clicking the submit button.
 
Events are notifications that you respond to with JAVAScript code. Events will be explained in details later.

JAVAScript interactivity occurs entirely within the browser without loading a new page 
eliminating the unnecessary passing of data back and forth to the server

JAVAScript doesn't allow you to read or write into user's hard drive. This way it can address issue of security on web. But someone
may write buggy JAVAScript code to breach security.

Interactivity in a web page can also be provided without JAVAScript.For that you can use third party add ons for the browser

in HTML, there is a tag called <script> which can be used to add JAVAScript code in a document.

<script type="text/javascript">
	write code here
</script>
  
"text/javascript" is MIME type to tell the browser to execute code using built-in JAVAScript interpreter.
Other scripting language used on client side are VBScript, ASP.NET AJAX etc.
