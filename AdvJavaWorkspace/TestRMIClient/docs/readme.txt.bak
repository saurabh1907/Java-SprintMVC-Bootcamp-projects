Objective:
------------

To understand RMI protocol.

Modules:
----------

1. compute	
	- This package contains Remote interface 'Compute', which contains remote methods that can be invoked by client.
	- It also contains an interface 'Task', which mandates client to implement task by implementing this interface.
		
2.	client
	- 	This package contains class 'Pi', which provides implementation that needs to be executed by server, 
		by implementing 'Task'.
		
	-	It also contains class 'ComputePi', which contains main().
		It returns the remote reference bound to the specified name in this RMI registry.
		Using this remote reference, which is type of 'Compute',we can execute methods on this remote object.
		
How to run:
-------------		 		 	

Copy client.policy in bin directory, first.
[You can find it in docs]

Go to command prompt:

> 	cd %workspace%\TestRMIClient\bin
> 	set classpath=									[To remove classpath, if any]

> 	java -Djava.security.policy=client.policy client.ComputePi file:///c:/webWorkspace/TestRMIClient/bin/ localhost 100

Command line arguments:

	args[0]:	the location where the client serves its classes (the Pi class) by using the java.rmi.server.codebase property
	args[1]:	the host name of the server (so that the client knows where to locate the Compute remote object)
	args[2]:	the number of decimal places to use in the calculation

Note:

 %workspace%	- 	replace workspace with the real location of your workspace. 
 
java -Djava.security.policy=client.policy -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://172.16.5.125:8080/BootStrapApp/ client.ComputePi 172.16.5.125 100
