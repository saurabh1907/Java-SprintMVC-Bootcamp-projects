encapsulation - bundling data and methods together with operate on each other
abstraction - focus on essential features of an element, ignoring unneccesary properties. 

stacktrace prints pending method calls

Error- stack overflow, memory out of bound, jvm linkage error
Exception-----runtime exception - logical bugs, can be always avoided, may not happen if code is modified ( doesn't interact with environment)
-environment issue( sql exception Io exception) 

int a[][] = new a[5][];
a[0] = new a[4];
a[1] = new a[3];
.

Person p[]= new Person[4];
Person[0] =new Person();

if method not using any class state make it static

assertEquals - two object are equal( object value equality)(Internally obj1.equals(obj2)
assertSame - two objects refer to the same object (reference value equality) (Internally obj1==obj2)


Object Class
hashcode() gives base address, however u cannot do anything ( used in hashbased datastructure)
protected clone() - native( code not present in java)


collection is Iterable. Iterable has Iterator

Map<K,V>

Interactive python data structure
hashcode contract in java

Rules regarding widening and autoboxing ---

* Primitive Widening > Boxing > Varargs.
* Widening and Boxing (WB) not allowed.
* Boxing and Widening (BW) allowed.
* While overloading, Widening + vararg and Boxing + vararg can only be used in a mutually exclusive manner i.e. not together.
* Widening between wrapper classes not allowed

Database connectivity
1> Load JDBC Driver
2>Get db connection by specifying JDBC url(MAIN protocl. DB specific protocol.info)
eg- JDBC.=mysql.http://localhost:3306/test
https://github.com/sanjaydegaonkar/IRP
process which gets a port no becomes a service

*Web container - which understands both http and programming language like java
*html pages are rendered and javascript pages are interpreted
* servlet context provides a boundary for n number of servlets
* resp.encodeURL() encode session id in url


MVC - used to provice seperation of concerns.
model has domain data, business logic, persistence mechanism.
