encapsulation - bundling data and methods together with operate on each other
abstraction - focus on essential features of an element, ignoring unneccesary properties. 

stacktrace prints pending method calls

Error- stack overflow, memory out of bound, jvm linkage error

hashcode() gives base address, however u cannot do anything ( used in hashbased datastructure)
protected clone() - native( code not present in java)


collection is Iterable. Iterable has Iterator

Map<K,V>

2>Get db connection by specifying JDBC url(MAIN protocl. DB specific protocol.info)
eg- JDBC.=mysql.http://localhost:3306/test

*Web container - which understands both http and programming language like java
*html pages are rendered and javascript pages are interpreted
* servlet context provides a boundary for n number of servlets
* resp.encodeURL() encode session id in url
